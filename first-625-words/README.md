## [Project 3: Pizza](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/3/project3.html)<br><br>


### **Overview**<br>

This is a project of a web application for handling online orders for a restaurant.

Users (customers) can register for the website and then log in, using their username and password. Once they log in, they can browse the restaurant's menus, add items to their cart, and submit their orders, using a credit card to make a purchase during checkout.

Users can also select a language for the website, as well select the currency for the menus' and orders' prices.

### **Features**<br>

This project has the following main features:

- **Registration:** Users can register for the website, providing a username and a password.

- **Login:** Users, once registered, can log in on the website with their username and password.

- **Logout**: Logged in users can log out of the site.

- **Unregistration:** Users can unregister from the website.

- **Menu Update:** Using Django Admin resources, site administrators (restaurant owners) can add, update and remove items on the menus.

- **Menus:** Users can see the various kinds of available menus in the restaurant. If there is only a kind of menu, then users see the page of that one.

- **Menu:** Once specified a menu, users can see a list the menu items, with their corresponding prices. Selecting an item, add it to the user's order.

- **Orders Items:** Users can see the details of an order item, and choose addings (like toppings or extras, for example) to add to the item, as well specify the number of each adding or even specify the number of that item in the order.

- **Shopping Cart:** Users can see the order items added to their virtual "shopping cart". The contents of the cart is saved even if a user closes the window or logs out and logs back in again.

- **Checkout:** Users can submit their orders for checkout to make the purchase using a credit card.

- **Select Language:** Users can select a language for the website.

- **Select Currency:** Users can select a currency for the menus and orders prices.
